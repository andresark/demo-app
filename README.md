## Usage

This project contains a tomcat war app and a bash script that installs and configures tomcat.

The demo app can be configured by running the below command.
NOTE: This has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 platform on AWS.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andresark/demo-app/master/demo-app.sh | sudo bash
```

Since tomcat serves requests on port 80 by default, the security group assigned to the newly created instances needs to allow incoming requests on port 80.


## Automating event generation

Add generate-ws-activities.sh to a crontab as below to generate logs to all modules every 30 minutes:


```
*/30 * * * * bash ~/generate-ws-activities.sh
```
